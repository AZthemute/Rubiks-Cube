// Create your own algorithms here!
// Lines beginning with // are ignored.
// The format of an algorithm is the following:
// Up, Left, Front, Right, Back, Algorithm
// The up face is a CSV string that can be read as a 2D array representing the colours on that face.
// The other faces are read anti-clockwise.
// Example algorithms below:
NNN,NNN,NNN	NNN	NNN	NNN	NNN	R R' U U'
GYG,WWW,BYB	YNY	ONR	YNY	RNO	R U R' U R U' R' U R U2 R'
